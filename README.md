Modern Car Sales Insights

 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical car sales data to uncover insights related to pricing,
profitability, vehicle condition, and mileage trends.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics workflow,
from raw data ingestion and cleaning to business-focused dashboarding and insights.

Tools & Technologies

- Databricks (SQL) for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- Google Looker Studio for interactive dashboarding
- GitHub for version control and project documentation
- CSV datasets for data storage and portability
-
-Business Questions Addressed

This analysis was designed to answer key business questions, including:

- What is the overall sales performance and average selling price?
- Which vehicle makes generate the highest profit margins?
- How does vehicle condition impact selling price and profitability?
- How does mileage influence vehicle pricing?
- Which vehicle segments present the best resale opportunities?

The answers to these questions help dealerships optimize pricing strategies,
inventory decisions, and profit expectations.

Interactive Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was created using Google Looker Studio to visualize
key insights from the analysis.

The dashboard highlights:
- Core sales KPIs
- Profit margin trends by vehicle make
- The impact of mileage and condition on pricing
